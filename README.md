# T.E.A.M. — The Exoskeleton Ancillary Machine  
**Support System for Powered Exoskeleton Users**

## 📌 Overview  
T.E.A.M. is an assistive robot designed to enhance the use of powered exoskeletons by addressing two major challenges: **limited battery life** and **environmental support**. This machine autonomously follows an exoskeleton user, provides external power through a retractable charging rod, analyzes gait data, and assists with emergency communication. T.E.A.M. aims to make exoskeletons more reliable, practical, and accessible for individuals with mobility impairments.

## 🎯 Purpose  
Powered exoskeletons show great promise in rehabilitation and personal mobility. However, they are often limited by high costs and short battery life. T.E.A.M. is designed to:
- Follow the user autonomously
- Provide mobile charging support
- Monitor terrain and user gait
- Offer emergency support functions

## ⚙️ Features  
- **Autonomous Tracking**: Uses computer vision to follow a visual tracking marker worn by the user  
- **Power Delivery**: Deployable charging rod extends from the robot to deliver external power  
- **Environmental Resilience**: Rugged, water-resistant design for sidewalk and light outdoor use  
- **Safety Assist**: Optional emergency signal system for user alerts

## 🧪 Testing Plan  
1. **Tracking Test** – T.E.A.M. follows a human target on a sidewalk-like surface using a mounted camera.  
2. **Power Support Test** – Measures the robot's ability to supply power through the extension rod.  
3. **Durability Test** – Evaluates function on uneven terrain and exposure to light rain.  
4. **Battery Comparison** – Compares exoskeleton use time with and without T.E.A.M. support.
