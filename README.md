T.E.A.M. — The Exoskeleton Ancillary Machine

Support System for Powered Exoskeleton Users

📌 Overview

T.E.A.M. is an assistive robot designed to enhance the use of powered exoskeletons by addressing two of the most pressing issues: limited battery life and environmental support. This machine follows the exoskeleton user, provides external power through a retractable charging rod, analyzes gait data, and assists in emergency communication. T.E.A.M. aims to make exoskeletons more reliable, practical, and accessible for users with mobility impairments.

🎯 Purpose

Powered exoskeletons have significant potential in rehabilitation, mobility assistance, and daily function support. However, their high cost and limited battery life restrict everyday use. T.E.A.M. is designed as a companion device that:

Follows the user autonomously
Provides on-the-go charging
Monitors terrain and gait
Offers safety support features
⚙️ Features

Autonomous Tracking: Uses computer vision to follow a tracking card or beacon worn by the exoskeleton user.
Power Delivery: Deployable charging rod connects to the exoskeleton to extend its operational time.
Environmental Resilience: Waterproof and rugged design allows for sidewalk and light trail use.
Safety Assist: Optional SOS alert system for emergencies.
🧪 Testing Plan

Tracking Test: T.E.A.M. follows a user wearing a tracking marker across a simulated sidewalk or path.
Power Support Test: The robot delivers charge via the extension rod and maintains voltage within safe limits.
Durability Test: T.E.A.M. is exposed to light rain, uneven terrain, and temperature variations.
Battery Performance Comparison: Users compare usage time of the exoskeleton with and without T.E.A.M.
